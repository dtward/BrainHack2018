# BrainHack2018

During BrainHack2018, with Josh Vogelstein and the neurodata lab, I made a goal to implement deformable image registration via Large Deformation Diffeomorphic Metric Mapping (LDDMM) in tensorflow.

It was first necessary to write functions to do linear interpolation at arbitrary points.  It was also necessary to write a function that takes the gradient of an image.

I have implemented it in 2D and am working on it in 3D.
